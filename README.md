# Face Detection and Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning

## üöÄ Overview  
This project focuses on building a **Deep Learning-based system** capable of:  

- Detecting human faces in images.  
- Classifying emotions into 7 categories:  
  - Angry  
  - Disgust  
  - Fear  
  - Happy  
  - Sad  
  - Surprise  
  - Neutral  

The system integrates advanced computer vision techniques and emotion recognition models to deliver accurate and efficient results.
